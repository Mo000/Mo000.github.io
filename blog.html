                Hi, my name is Michael and I'm a first year Computer Science student at the University of Sheffield. I go to the Diamond nearly every day as I have lectures there, and I often find myself using the fourth floor of the diamond's silent study rooms. There are usually spaces available and sometimes I can get a computer, however as a Computer Science student I find myself carrying a laptop most of the time anyway, so although I may not always be able to find a computer, I don't usually need one.<br><br>
                I was able to book a group study room for a group work project I have in one of my modules, which proved to be very useful. It had a monitor and a projector which we were able to hook up to a laptop and it certainly boosted our productivity.<br><br>
                The library reference collection contains many standard referencing books, and I was able to find a book to reference, about CPU transistors, which vastly helped me in my group project. There's a plethora of references available for collection there for all topics, especially Computer Science.
