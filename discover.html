            <p>The top floor of the diamond has many useful facilities available for students to use. It contains a wide range of space and rooms for silent study, group study; all of which are facilitated with modern computers, desks, and electric sockets. The floor has plenty of toilets including disabled toilets, and four different lifts & staircases at each corner of the floor.
            <br><br>
            There are many media rooms, and specifically 8 acoustically insulated recording booths, a tv studio with fixed cameras, multi-point recording, and a green screen, as well as several rooms with media editing facilities, a small flexible teaching space (the skills suite), and a library collection of 10,000 reference books.
